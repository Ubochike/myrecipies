   <p> Jollof rice is a popular West African dish known for its delicious blend of flavors and vibrant red color.

Here's a simple recipe to guide you in making this delectable dish.</p>
   <h2>Ingredients</h2>
   <ul>
   <li>2 cups long-grain parboiled rice</li>
<li>4 cups vegetable oil</li>
<li>1 medium onion, finely chopped</li>
<li>2-3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
<li>1-2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
<li>1 can (14 oz) diced tomatoes or 2 large fresh tomatoes, blended</li>
<li>1 red bell pepper, blended</li>
<li>1 green bell pepper, blended</li>
<li>1 Scotch bonnet pepper (or to taste), blended (be cautious, as it's very spicy)</li>
<li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
<li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon paprika or cayenne pepper (optional, for additional spiciness)</li>
<li>2-3 bay leaves</li>
<li>4-5 cups chicken or vegetable broth</li>
<li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
<li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro or parsley (for garnish)</li>
   </ul>
   <h2>Procedures</h2>
   <ol>
   <li>Rinse the rice thoroughly under cold water until the water runs clear. Soak the rice in water for about 30 minutes, then drain and set aside.</li> 
   <li>In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or a Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onions and saut√© until they become translucent.
<li>Stir in the minced garlic and tomato paste, and cook for an additional minute or two to get rid of the raw taste of the tomato pasteStir</li>
<li>Add the blended tomatoes, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, and Scotch bonnet pepper to the pot. Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, until most of the liquid has evaporated, and the mixture becomes thicker and the oil starts to separate (this is called "frying the tomato base").</li>
<li>Season the tomato base with thyme, curry powder, paprika or cayenne pepper (if using), bay leaves, salt, and pepper. Stir well to incorporate the spices.</li>
<li>Add the soaked and drained rice to the pot and stir to coat the rice evenly with the tomato base.</li>
<li>Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth. The liquid should cover the rice by about half an inch. If needed, adjust the salt at this stage to taste. Bring the mixture to a boil.</li>
<li>Once it starts boiling, reduce the heat to low, cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid, and let the rice simmer for about 20-25 minutes or until the rice is fully cooked and has absorbed the liquid. Avoid stirring the rice while it's cooking to prevent it from becoming mushy.</li>
<li>About 5 minutes before the rice is fully cooked, gently stir in the frozen mixed vegetables, allowing them to steam along with the rice.</li>
<li>Once the rice is cooked and the liquid has been fully absorbed, remove the pot from the heat. Let the rice rest, covered, for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld.</li>
<li>Fluff the jollof rice with a fork, and garnish with chopped fresh cilantro or parsley.</li>
